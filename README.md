# Cryptography

## Language chosen: C++
The reason for the use of c++ is for ease of parallelism

## Homework 4
Create an 6 functions:
- Modulo function that works for positive and negative numbers
- GCD function
- GCDEX function to find s and t form the equation m*s + n*t = 1
- Modular inverse function to find a^(-1) mod n
- Chinese Remainder Theorem function
- A power mod function, powmod(a,b,n) calculates a^b mod n

Decided to make a class structure for these functions
