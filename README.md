## Language chosen: C++
The reason for the use of c++ is for ease of parallelism

## Homework 4
Create 6 functions:
- Modulo function that works for positive and negative numbers
    - divide the number by n and subtract the result from the number
    - if negative add the n to the number until positive and run the above
- GCD function
    - Given 2 numbers: find the Greatest Common Divisor
    - Run the euclidian algorithm, The number that is left Rn is the divisor
- GCDEX function to find s and t form the equation m*s + n*t = 1
    - 
- Modular inverse function to find a^(-1) mod n
    - 
- Chinese Remainder Theorem function
- A power mod function, powmod(a,b,n) calculates a^b mod n
