\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}
This is the Introduction of my document
- Some history maybe
- the DES explained
- The simplified DES explained
- maybe run through an example 

\section*{Overall Design}
This is where I will discuss the overall design of my project.

\section*{Building a Cluster}
This is where I will discuss how I built a beowulf cluster 

\section*{Using OpenMPI to parallelize accross the nodes}
This will be where I will discuss how I plan to implement a program to do the simplified version of the DES using parallelism.

\section*{Using OpenMP to parallelize the computation on each machine}
This will be where i will discuss how I plan to implement a program to parallelize each run of the DES algorithm.
